# lostvoices
AI Digital Memorial to Lost Voices - honoring women murdered, raped, abused, or assaulted by men in war and peace. We visualize their disappearance into dark waters, symbolizing loss, erasure, and the urgency for justice—inspired by the German Lost Girl and Natalie Wood’s husband's 6-min interview, a reminder that patriarchy persists.
